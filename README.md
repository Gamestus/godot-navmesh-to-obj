# godot-navmesh-to-obj
  Script created by Gamet (github.com/Gamestus), some code remixed from CSGExport plugin by Xtremezero (github.com/mohammedzero43).
  This plugin adds an export button when selecting NavigationMeshInstance Node.
  Exported object name ends with "-navmesh" so Godot will import it as navigation mesh automatically*.
 *You should import .obj file as Scene.
